# FINDABILITY

## F1 - unique ID
### Assign training materials and their metadata identifiers

For both:
* separate PIDs
  * lasting metadata if digital object disappears
  * accessible metadata when training materials aren't open
* PIDs must be linked
* how to get PIDs for these?
  * SOP must contain clear instructions
* select relevant ontology/thesaurus
* include version information?
  * when is a new PID necessary? ex: typo, new version/release

For training materials:
* FAIR principles should refer to digital objects rather than data
* versioning control system?
  * bc training materials evolve and need updating

## F2 - rich metadata
### Data (*training materials) are described with rich metadata

* define "rich" - minimum set of metadata
  * do we decide or do we explain principles?
* findability
  * where should the metadata appear?
  * how to link to materials?
* instructions for annotation with bio/schemas
  * how to implement them for a training structure

## F3 - inclusion of ID
### Metadata clearly/explicitly include identifier of training materials they describe

Include:
* identifier form - should be consistent and machine-actionable
  * short
  * URL
* identifier link to earlier versions?

## F4 - indexed registries
### Meta/data are registered in a resource that is indexed, searchable, and compatible with community

* include which resources for which types of materials/metadata
  * training materials must be findable from metadata
  * but not necessarily registered in the same resource
* clarify register vs index
  * course metadata is registered on uni web page
  * training material is indexed through uni web page (but not accessible)

Implementation:
* contact information
  * especially when material is not open
* required/recommended metadata fields
* link to training materials if open/available
* taxonomy of the material
* archiving options
* how to deal with versioning/updates
