## FINDABILITY

### F1 - unique ID
#### Assign training materials and their metadata identifiers

For both:

* separate PIDs
  * lasting metadata if digital object disappears
  * accessible metadata when training materials aren't open
* PIDs must be linked
* how to get PIDs for these?
  * SOP must contain clear instructions
* select relevant ontology/thesaurus
* include version information?
  * when is a new PID necessary? ex: typo, new version/release

For training materials:

* FAIR principles should refer to digital objects rather than data
* versioning control system?
  * bc training materials evolve and need updating

### F2 - rich metadata
#### Data (*training materials) are described with rich metadata

* define "rich" - minimum set of metadata
  * do we decide or do we explain principles?
* findability
  * where should the metadata appear?
  * how to link to materials?
* instructions for annotation with bio/schemas
  * how to implement them for a training structure

### F3 - inclusion of ID
#### Metadata clearly/explicitly include identifier of training materials they describe

Include:

* identifier form - should be consistent and machine-actionable
  * short
  * URL
* identifier link to earlier versions?

### F4 - indexed registries
#### Meta/data are registered in a resource that is indexed, searchable, and compatible with community

* include which resources for which types of materials/metadata
  * training materials must be findable from metadata
  * but not necessarily registered in the same resource
* clarify register vs index
  * course metadata is registered on uni web page
  * training material is indexed through uni web page (but not accessible)

Implementation:

* contact information
  * especially when material is not open
* required/recommended metadata fields
* link to training materials if open/available
* taxonomy of the material
* archiving options
* how to deal with versioning/updates

## ACCESSIBILITY

### A1 - retrieval by identifier
#### Meta/data are retrievable by identifier using standardized communication protocol

Note: physical/lab training requires different principles from digital/computational training

Explain/show examples where training material is/is not retrievable

### A1.1 - protocol
#### The (communication?) protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

### A1.2 - authentication and authorization
#### The protocol allows for authentication and authorization where necessary

	• if this is necessary, SOP must include instructions
	• metadata should explicitly state if these are necessary to access the training material

### A1.3 - alt accessibility
#### Include how to make materials accessible for different access needs/assistive technology

	• ALT text to images
	• transcripts
	• ensure reading order is correct for screen readers
	• accessible fonts
	• color contrast

### A2 - metadata availability beyond data
#### Metadata should be accessible even when data is no long available

	• info on registries/repositories should include how long they preserve metadata
