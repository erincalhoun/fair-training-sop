## Why should training be FAIR?

Making training materials FAIR is essential for ensuring that they can be easily found, accessed, and used. Adhering to FAIR principles not only broadens your potential audience but also facilitates collaboration and resource sharing, making the development process more efficient.

## Purpose

To provide a comprehensive recipe for creating Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) training materials in alignment with the guidelines and best practices established by "Ten Simple Rules for making training materials FAIR" (2020 Garcia et al.) and ELIXIR Europe's FAIR training handbook.

## Scope

This procedure applies to the creation of any training materials, including slides, presentations, videos, manuals, tutorials, and courses, with the aim of adhering to FAIR principles.

## Preparation and planning

1. Review the FAIR principles and guidelines laid out by "Ten Simple Rules for making training materials FAIR" and ELIXIR Europe's FAIR training handbook.

2. Identify the target audience, learning objectives, and desired outcomes for the training materials.

3. Develop a content outline with an accompanying lesson plan.

## Creating findable training materials
1. Assign unique, persistent identifiers.

2. Optimize the training materials for searching by using appropriate keywords, metadata, and markup language. Bioschemas has three profiles for training materials and courses.

3. Create metadata and descriptions that accurately describe the training materials using EDAM.

4. Register the training materials and metadata in relevant repositories and registries including TeSS.

## Creating accessible training materials
1. Ensure that the training materials are available online, preferably with open access.

2. Choose standard, open formats for the materials to ensure compatibility with various devices and software.

3. Provide alternative formats (for example alt-text on slides/documents and text transcripts for video content) to accommodate diverse user needs and preferences.

4. Implement accessibility best practices, such as using clear fonts, high contrast colors, and appropriate text size.

## Creating interoperable training materials
1. Use common, standardized vocabularies, ontologies, and data formats throughout the materials.

2. Incorporate links or references to related resources, guidelines, and tools to facilitate integration with other materials.

3. Provide clear instructions for using, modifying, and extending the training materials.

# Creating reusable training materials
1. Clearly state the licensing terms and conditions for the training materials, preferably using a Creative Commons or other open license.

2. Include detailed instructions, examples, and explanations to support users in understanding and applying the content.

3. Regularly update the training materials to ensure their continued relevance and accuracy.

4. Encourage feedback and collaboration from users to improve the materials and promote their reuse.

## Evaluation and improvement
1. Collect feedback from users on the effectiveness, usability, and accessibility of the training materials.

2. Monitor usage statistics, such as the number of views, downloads, and citations, to assess the materials' impact and visibility.

3. Periodically review and update the training materials based on user feedback, new developments, and evolving best practices.

4. Share experiences and lessons learned with the broader FAIR training community to contribute to ongoing improvement and collaboration.
